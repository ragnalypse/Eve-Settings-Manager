# Eve-Settings-Manager

Small utility to copy all client settings from one account/user to the others.

This is very useful for duplicating the exact same user interface and general settings across multiple characters.

This will copy ALL client settings (interface, audio, chat, shortcuts, etc).


How it works:

-Close all EVE clients.

-Log in to one of your character's accounts.

-Configure all settings, window locations, overview settings, chat channels, etc.

-Close the EVE client and EVE Launcher.

-Run the Eve Settings Manager program.

-Enter the location of your EVE client profile settings (more info below).

-Select whether to copy User settings or Character settings (or both).

-Select the source user/character. This should be the first option in the list as it is sorted by last-used date.

-Click the Copy button.

-Done


The settings will be copied across all your accounts. Very useful to duplicate your settings so they are the exact same across all characters/accounts.

You must specify the location of your EVE client profile directory. Usually this is located in your local APPDATA folder, examples are:

-C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\CCP\EVE\c_program_files_(x86)_ccp_eve_tranquility\settings

-C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\CCP\EVE\c_programdata_ccp_eve_sharedcache_tq_tranquility\settings_Default


You can open to your APPDATA directory by typing Win+R and pasting %LocalAppData% in the command box.
